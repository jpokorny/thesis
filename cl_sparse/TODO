failing tests:
==============


others:
=======

priority
--------
double deref as with hash_table.c: 82 (cl_pp is dying)


not to forget
-------------
type recursion for (typedef'd) functions?



sparse:
=======
* does not complain about nonsensical recursive type (see tests/struct/rs1-01.c.bad)
* generates phi instruction after unssa (hash_table.c: 85)


code listener:
==============

* accessors with CL_OPERAND_CST
* type->items for CL_TYPE_FNC ([0] = return value, [1+] = args, why one extra
                               expected?)
