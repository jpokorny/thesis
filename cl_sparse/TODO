failing tests:
==============


others:
=======

priority
--------
finish union
bring the signals back (as it sometimes ends without printing sparse messages)


not to forget
-------------
type recursion
-- with (typedef'd) functions?
-- during adjust_cl_operand_accessors?



sparse:
=======
* does not complain about nonsensical recursive type (see tests/struct/rs1-01.c.bad)
* generates phi instruction after unssa (hash_table.c: 85)


code listener:
==============

* accessors with CL_OPERAND_CST
* type->items for CL_TYPE_FNC ([0] = return value, [1+] = args, why one extra
                               expected?)
* CL_TYPE_REAL with `cl_pp'
